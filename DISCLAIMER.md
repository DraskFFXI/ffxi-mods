I spent a good bit of time back in retail downloading DAT changes that tweaked the look/feel of my client-side game. Meaning the DAT changes were only visible on my-end, not anyone else's.

I wanted to bring back a small handful of those changes. However,  after searching the internet and the Internet Archive, I found that the FFXI DAT library website has been offline for many years now and those files are gone.

Saddened by this discovery, I rummaged through old boxes and found old external hard drives from years back. I luckily located a few of these DATs, and I'm here to share with you all--if you want them.

I've already implemented these via XIPivot and have zipped everything up for you to just copy/paste into the proper folder. You can disable them in the launcher or delete the folder(s) as you see fit.

I've zipped everything up and included instructions on how to use/remove.


Disclaimer:
I do not claim any creative rights to the shared files. I am simply sharing what is no longer available on the internet.

Final Fantasy 11 DAT Modifications

I've simplified everything for you thanks to XIPivot. I've placed all the modified DAT files in their proper path for XIPivot to use.

About:
--------------------
I spent a good bit of time back in retail downloading DAT changes that tweaked the look/feel of my client-side game. Meaning the DAT changes were only visible on my-end, not anyone else's.

I wanted to bring back a small handful of those changes. However,  after searching the internet and the Internet Archive, I found that the FFXI DAT library website has been offline for many years now and those files are gone.

Saddened by this discovery, I rummaged through old boxes and found old external hard drives from years back. I luckily located a few of these DATs, and I'm here to share with you all--if you want them.

I've already implemented these via XIPivot and have zipped everything up for you to just copy/paste into the proper folder. You can disable them in the launcher or delete the folder(s) as you see fit.

I've zipped everything up and included instructions on how to use/remove.


Disclaimer:
--------------------
I do not claim any creative rights to the shared files. I am simply sharing what is no longer available on the internet.




Install Directions:
--------------------

1. Open your game install path to the 'polplugins\DATs' folder. Example below:
** IE: C:\HorizonXI\Game\polplugins\DATs

2. Within the zip file, Copy/Move/Drag-drop those folders into the game path's 'polplugins\DATs' folder

3. Launch the game and enjoy. They are enabled by default via the launcher.


Uninstall Directions:
----------------------

If you want to ever disable any of these DAT changes, you can either method:

Launcher Method:
1. Settings > Pivot

2. Use the on/off toggle for any you do not want activated.


In-Game Method:
1. Type "/pivot" to load the XIPivot GUI.

2. Within that GUI you can press the minus (-) button next to the item you no longer want to use.

3. It is recommended to restart the game after doing this.


Permanent Method:
1. Open your game install path to the 'polplugins\DATs' folder. Example below:
** IE: C:\HorizonXI\Game\polplugins\DATs

2. Select the mod folders you no longer want on your computer and delete them.
